#### HRP-3L

Junichi Urata and other members of the Jouhou System Kougaku Laboratory at the University of Tokyo took the lower half of an HRP-3 (referred to as HRP-3L) and increased the strength of the robot dramatically. Electronics, knee joints, gears, some structures, and all the motors were replaced. The HRP-3 150W Maxon motors were swapped for 200W Maxon motors with custom water cooling. The maximum current is 125 Amps, which is about seventeen times greater than current rating of the motor (using air cooling). A two layer capacitor was added to supply (and absorb) large current spikes that the battery wouldn’t be able to handle alone. The knee joint is capable of speeds up to 1000 degrees per second and applying up to 350 Nm of torque.

Junichi Urata and Nakanishi wanted to form a team for the Darpa Robotics Challenge, but as University of Tokyo researchers they could not receive funding from a military agency. They left the University of Tokyo and founded SCHAFT, with Nakanishi as CEO and Urata as CTO.

#### S-Taro

In _Development and Verification of Life-Size Humanoid with High-Output Actuation System_, the S-Taro humanoid is described in detail. The arm is made up of four 2-axis modules. The modules use air cooled 30mm MAXON EC-4pole motors attached to harmonic drives for gear reduction. These same modules are used for the head and waist. The knee and hip joints are made up of two water cooled motors each. For cooling the motors and motor controllers, there is a total of 2 liters of coolant water flowing through S-Taro. The robot is powered by an external 13 farad capacitor.

S-Taro is extremely strong. One of its arms on it’s own weighs 9.2 kg and can lift 35 kg (in this experiment the max torque achieved was 158 Nm). The leg is limited to 100 kg due to the torque limit of the harmonic drives and belts. The researchers demonstrated the robot’s lower torso stepping with an additional 100 kg added to the torso.

Dave Coleman posted a [blog post](http://dav.ee/blog/archives/697) in 2014 showing S-Taro. This robot was still in the JSK laboratory so it most likely predates the foundation of Schaft.

#### S-One

At the Humanoids 2012 conference in Osaka, Japan, a quick preview of Schaft's S-One was shown at the end of one of JSK's presentations. This robot would later go on to get the highest score in the Darpa Robotics Trials.

Google acquired Schaft just a few months before the DARPA Trials. According to rumors, the employees of Schaft were told not to talk to the media and also tried to stop people from taking closeup photos of their robot.

Not much was publicly revealed about the hardware. S-One uses Robotiq’s Adaptive Gripper. S-One also still uses water cooled motors and motor controllers shown below in a photo later taken down from their website.

Google pulled Schaft out of the Darpa Robotics Challenge and there was no news of any kind for three years.

#### Unnamed bipedal robot

Only shown publicly at the New Economic Summit (NEST) 2016 in Tokyo, this unnamed bipedal robot was Schaft’s last project. The robot uses linear slides instead of a traditional humanoid leg layout. The robot can lift 60 kg and travel over uneven terrain and stairs.

On Nov 15th 2018, Alphabet (Google’s holding company) announced they would shut down Schaft after failing to find a buyer for the company. 

#### Where are they today?

S-Taro was shown in the JSK lab as of February 2014. I would assume the lab also still has HRP-3L-JSK somewhere in storage. As for the hardware made by Schaft, it is most likely deep in the vaults of Google/Alphabet along with all the IP. 

Nakanishi Yuto currently works at GITAI, a Japanese startup currently developing robots for use in space. Junichi Urata has not published any papers since co-founding Schaft.
