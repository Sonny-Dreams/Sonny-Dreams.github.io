title: HOAP-2 Robot Teardown Part 1
---

HOAP-2 is the second in a series of three humanoid robots made by Fujitsu Automation. HOAP stands for Humanoid for Open Architecture Platform. HOAP-2 was released in 2003 and is 48 cm high and weights about 7 kg. 

I managed to aquire HOAP-2 SN:0010 from Yahoo Japan Auctions. It came with the power cord and USB cord but no software or power supply. It took me a week or so to track down the English user's manual using the wayback machine.

The power cable that came with the robot is a beefy amlost XLR like cable. Because I didn't have an adapter handy (for the weird 3 pin format), I managed to power up the robot through the battery port in the robot's backpack. I am assuming the NiCad battery was not included for saftey reasons (or was lost by the owner). Luckily, my HOAP-2 includes the wireless add-on package. This includes an aditional computer shown below (powered by an AMD Geode processor).

The two things I need to get this robot walking again are the software (which I can hopefully dump from the CF card) and the startup jig. Like many humanoids, HOAP-2 cannot remember the zero positions of it's joints, so you must zero every joint using a special jig. The user manual doesn't give exact measurements for this jig, but does show some photos.
