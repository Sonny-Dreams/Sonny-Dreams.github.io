"The Humanoid Robotics Project (HRP) was an R&D project sponsored by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan from 1998 JFY (Japan fiscal year) to 2002 for 5 years. The objective of the project was to develop a safe and reliable human-friendly robot system which can carry out complicated tasks and human supports within the sphere of human activity. One of the sources of inspiration for this project was the technological progress in robotics and information processing typically represented by the Honda humanoid robot P2 which was announced to public in 1996. Another motivation for this project was Japan’s demands for supporting people’s daily life caused by decrease of birth rate and increase of aging population.

The robot is an enhanced version of Honda P3, which provides interface for teleoperation and various applications. Four copies of HRP-1 were built and evaluated in the following scenarios: maintenance tasks of industrial plants, human care, teleoperations of construction machines, and security services for home and office." - _HRP Robots_ by Shuuji Kajita

#### Where are they now?
Four HRP-1S robots were built. One shown in the video above was modified to have a screen for a head and a slighly different paint job. One HRP-1S was on display at the Science Museum in Kitanomaru Kōen, Chiyoda, Tokyo, Japan as of May 30th, 2010. A HRP-1S was on display at the Miraikan science museum in Tokyo in January of 2012 (by January 2021 it was no longer on display).
