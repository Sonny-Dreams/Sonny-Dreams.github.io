The University of Tokyo has several labs that have contributed greatly to the field of humanoid robotics. This article will go over just the research from the Jouhou System Kougaku (JSK) Laboratory within the department of Mechano Informatics.

## HARP ##

Humanoid Autonomous Robot Platform (HARP) started in 1991. H3 is a stationary upper torso and H4 is a humanoid upper body mounted on an electric wheelchair. 

## H5 ##

H5 is a humanoid robot that dynamically walks using Zero Moment Point. The robot has a total of 30 DoF: 6 DoF for each arm and leg, 1 DoF for each gripper, and an additional 4 DoF for the head. H5 is 1270 mm tall and has a weight of 33 kg.

More details can be found in the research paper “ダイナミックヒューマノイドH5の開発”.


## H6 ##

H6 was assembled in 2000 by the Aircraft and Mechanical Systems Division of Kawada Industries. The robot has the same 6 DoF in each leg as H5, but adds a toe joint. There is also now 7 DoF in each arm, 1 DoF for each gripper, 2 DoF for the neck, and 3 DoF for the eyes. This brings the total to 35. H5 is 1370 mm tall and weighs 55 kg including batteries. The robot features dual Pentium III processors allowing the robot to operate with no tether (power or control). 

## H7 ##

Also built by Kawada Industries, H7 features stronger actuators in a similar arrangement as H6. The robot is 1468 mm tall and weighs 57 kg. Custom 6-axis force sensors were designed and mounted in each foot. Four lead acid batteries power the robot.

In 2004, H7’s arms were remodeled, giving the robot 3 DoF grippers.

## Isamu ##

![isamu robot walking]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/JSK-2.jpg "isamu robot walking")


Isamu (Integrated System of Advanced Motion-control Units) is a humanoid created by Kawada Industries in 2001. The robot is heavily based off of H6 and H7; JSK lab also developed the control software. Isamu is 1468 mm tall with a weight of 55 kg. The maximum walking speed is 2 km/h. The robot can hold 2 kg in it’s gripper. The built in lead acid batteries only allow for 7 minutes of operation. 

This robot was only shown off in an operational state once or twice (I cannot find any pictures from IREX 2001). I have been unable to find any surviving video footage.

## HRP-2 ##

Built by Kawada Industries with experience gained from H6 and H7. JSK uses it’s two HRP-2’s in four research areas: environment recognition by 3D vision, whole-body motion planning,  whole-body learning through leading, and daily household assistance. Also competed in the DARPA Robotics Challenge under team HRP2-TOKYO.

## Musculoskeletal Robots ##

### TH1 ###

![TH1 robot static]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/JSK-3.jpg "TH1 robot static")

Tendon-driven humanoid developed in 1999. “Establishment & verification of the method to drive a spherical joint structure with many muscles”

### Kenta ###

![Kenta robot in multiple poses]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/JSK-4.jpg "Kenta robot in multiple poses")

Whole-body tendon driven humanoid with flexible spine. Height of 1230 mm and weight of 19 kg. There are 132 motors and over 400 sensors. More info in _The Design and Control of the Flexible Spine of a Fully Tendon-Driven Humanoid “Kenta”_

### Kotaro ###

Shown at the Prototype Robot Exhibition at the Aichi EXPO in 2005, Kotaro features 91 DoF. Each motor is 4.5 watts. The ball joints used a cell phone camera sensor to measure position. Even the eyes are tendon driven. Skeleton structure printed using stereolithography. More information in _A Musculoskeletal Flexible-Spine Humanoid Kotaro Aiming at the Future in 15 years’ time_.

### Kojiro ###

Increased actuator strength compared to Kotaro by replacing 4.5 watt DC motors with 40 watt Maxon EC16 motors. Not clear if the robot was ever able to balance on its own.

### Kenzoh ###

![Kenzoh robot in multiple poses]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/JSK-5.jpg "Kenzoh robot in multiple poses")

Only the upper body. Non-linear elastic elements in tendons to achieve variable stiffness joints. 

### Kenshiro ###

Screw-Home Mechanism(SHM) provides a yaw rotational DOF and a locking mechanism by mimicking functions of the human knee. Able to balance upright and walk slowly.  

### Kengoro ###

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RA4u_9FLzso" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Can do push-ups, crunches and sit-ups. Cools it’s 108 motors by sweating. Frame is sintered metal to allow water to seep through. “Can run for half a day on about a cup of deionized water.” Kengoro is 1700 mm tall and weighs 56 kg. 



## HRP-3L and SCHAFT ##

Junichi Urata and other members of the JSK lab took the lower half of an HRP-3 (referred to as HRP-3L) and increased the strength of the robot dramatically.

Junichi Urata and Nakanishi wanted to form a team for the Darpa Robotics Challenge, but as University of Tokyo researchers they could not receive funding from a military agency. They left the University of Tokyo and founded SCHAFT, with Nakanishi as CEO and Urata as CTO.

## JAXON ##

Competed in the DARPA Robotics Challenge as team NEDO-JSK. Uses similar technology as HRP-3L and S-Taro such as water cooled motor drivers and water cooled Maxon EC-4pole motors. Software was developed on HRP-2 and S-Taro as the hardware development was only started in July of 2014 (the DRC finals were in June of 2015). JAXON is 1880 mm tall and weighs 127 kg. JAXON has 6 DoF in each leg, 8 DoF in each arm, a 3 DoF torso, and a 2 DoF neck for a total of 32 DoF without grippers. The knee joint uses a harmonic drive with a gear ratio of 100:1 allowing for a max torque of 492 NM. The max joint torques were designed to allow Jaxon to step up a 400 mm step.

Redesigned JAXON3-P uses 2 water-cooled EC-4pole 30 motors for the knee. The knee features a gear set (not a harmonic!) with a ratio of 18:1 then a cable-pulley transmission with a ratio of 180:11. This gives the joint a continuous torque output of 516 NM and a limit torque of 700 NM. So far JAXON3-P has been demonstrated jumping across a 0.47 meter gap, jumping off a step, and jumping 0.3 meters vertically.

## RHP (Kaleido) ##

Robust Humanoid Platform (RHP) was designed with a similar joint configuration and joint motion range as JAXON, except for the exclusion of a yaw axis in the torso. Instead of using rotational joints and harmonic drives, RHP uses linear actuators made from ball screws. 

Professor Masayuki Inaba, from the JSK lab, added force sensors to the ankles of the robot to prevent it from falling. The robot—which had previously only been able to walk on all fours or holding onto surrounding objects— was now able to walk upright unassisted.
