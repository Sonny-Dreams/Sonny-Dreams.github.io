#### Asimo 2004

On December 15th, 2004, Honda unveiled a major revision to Asimo. Asimo(2004) can walk at up to 2.5 km/h, and can run at 3 km/h. In order to run, Asimo(2004) lifts both feet off of the ground for 0.05 seconds. Asimo(2004) is 10 cm taller at 130 cm and weighs 54 kg. The battery life has doubled to 1 hour due to a 51.8 V Lithium Ion battery pack. Asimo(2004) also features 34 DoF: a hip rotational joint which helps cancel out reaction force from faster walking, two wrist joints per arm, thumb joint (all 5 fingers were driven by one motor before), and an aditional neck joint. In order to achieve that 3 km/h speed, Asimo(2004) has new high speed motor drive units, light-weight legs, and new control theory to prevent spinning and slipping. It’s also important to note that Asimo(2004) has a completely redesigned exterior, featuring a smaller “backpack” and lights on either side of the head.
