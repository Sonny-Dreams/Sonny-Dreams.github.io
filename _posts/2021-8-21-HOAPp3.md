I managed to acquire a HOAP-1 robot from ebay. This specific one is serial number 0044. It came with the power supply and “joint initial setting rig”. While I could hack together my own power cable, I did need the jig to set the initial points of each servo motor. Luckily this jig is very similar to the one for HOAP-2, so I can probably use it to set HOAP-2 robot’s servo positions as well.

While trying to get the robot running, the first thing I noticed is that the power supply was not outputting any voltage. I decided to continue testing, but my bench power supply is only powerful enough to power the computer (not the servos). I set up an old router with what I thought was the correct settings to get the robot to automatically connect. Unfortunately, the manual is not very clear. In fact, I have to use the manual for HOAP-2 as I haven’t been able to locate a manual for HOAP-1 in either English or Japanese. I went through the robot’s OS files and took screenshots of the networking config. I couldn’t find the SSID though. I will come back to this in the next update.

I also managed to find some robocup code (and other examples) from the National University of Singapore (which I am 99% sure this robot was from).

I dumped the compact flash that contains examples and the OS. You can grab it here: <https://archive.org/details/hoap-2-cf.tar_202108>
