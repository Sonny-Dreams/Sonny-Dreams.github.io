The main improvement over HRP-2 was to create a robot in accordance with IEC IP52 (splash-proof and dust-proof). In order to deal with the stricter cooling requirements, the motor controllers for the arms were moved into the core of the robot. Also each arm got an additional DoF over HRP-2 (7 per arm vs 6 per arm). The redundant DOF was effective to avoid collisions between the arms and the body. Second, each hand of HRP-3 had three fingers of total 6 DOF, while HRP-2â€™s hand was a 1 DOF gripper.

#### Where are they today?
One HRP-3P and one HRP-3 are on display at Science Square TSUKUBA as part of the "Wonders of Science" exhibit.

HRP-3 can be seen in a recent video by AIST that shows them on display at their headquarters.
