P3 used the same battery, a 138V 6Ah Nickel Zink battery, as P2 but it lasted about 25 minutes due to the reduced weight of the robot. P3 also used two Micro SPARC II microprocessors clocked at 110 Mhz. Each leg is 6 DoF, each arm is 7 DoF, each hand is 2 DoF, plus an additional two DoF for the head bring the total to 32. The actuators use a brushless DC motor combined with a harmonic gearbox. The link between joints is made of magnesium. P3 has a maximum walking speed of 2 km/h. P3 also includes a wireless ethernet modem, two cameras, a “tiltmeter”, a gyroscope, and a 6-axis force sensor on each ankle and wrist.

#### Where Are They Today?
Only one P3 is on permanent display and is currently at Twin Ring Motegi in Japan. The total number of P3's built is unkown, but footage from the NHK documentary “Beyond the Century” shows four in one room (including the prototype wihout an articulated head).


#### Aditional Info

A silver colored P3 can be seen in this documentary clip. No other variations (other than the prototype) are known to exist.
