title: HOAP-2 Robot Teardown Part 2
---

The only progress I made from my last post is on the software front. Unfortunately, I haven’t been able to get ahold of a dump of either software CD that came with HOAP-2. The good news is that the data on the compact flash card contained in the wireless add-on computer was not corrupted. Using Ubuntu 20.04, I was able to duplicate the disc image for safe keeping. 

Download link is <https://archive.org/details/hoap-2-cf.tar>

The picture above shows the included ZMP walking example. Strangely it is stored as a CSV. This makes me pretty certain that it uses no active stabilization. At the size of HOAP-2, it’s probably stable enough using an entirely preplanned motion. I included this example file in the Internet Archive link above. I will update this article once I have an idea of what each column of data represents.
