P1 has 30 degrees of freedom, weighs 175 kg, and is 191.5 cm tall. P1 does not include control computers or a battery, so it must always be tethered. A P1, assumed to be the only one built, is on display at Twin Ring Motegi along with the entire E series of robots. P1 wasn't announced to the public until the unveiling of P2.
