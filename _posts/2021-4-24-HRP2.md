HRP-2L was developed by AIST and Kawada Industries Inc. in 2001. HRP-2L was a 12 DOF biped robot with 1413 mm height and 58.2 kg weight, which consisted of the leg mechanism, a control computer, batteries, and a dummy weight of 22.6 kg. The cantilever type structure, which reduces collision between the thighs, gives the following advantages: a wide area of landing point for swinging leg and cross-legged walk (like on a balance beam).

After the successful development of HRP-2L, HRP-2P was developed by AIST, Yaskawa Electric Corporation, and Kawada Industries Inc. in 2002.  HRP-2P has pitch and yaw DoFs in its waist, allowing it to get up from the floor (HRP-1 did not have these DoFs).

Mr. Yutaka Izubuchi designed the distinctive appearance of HRP-2, which only differs in height and weight slightly from HRP-2P. However, there are several internal differences. For example, the mechanical links were designed using FEM analysis to increase rigidity which was necessary for stable walking. Another improvement was the cooling systems that ventilates the inside of the body and links, which prevents overheating of the motors and electronics.

HRP-2 running leg module (HRP-2LR) is a modified version of HRP-2L that reduces the weight in order to increase possible running speed (height 127 cm, weight 31 kg, total 12 degrees of freedom). World's first successful running with a human-sized two-legged robot with a height of 120 cm or more. First free running humanoid was Sony’s Qrio, and Asimo gained the ability to run in 2004. 

#### HRP-2 with wheels (HRP-2V ?)

#### HRP-2FX

Constructed as a cheaper way to test dynamics of a falling humanoid robot.

#### HRP-2M

AIST in partnership with General Robotix and Moving Eyes, Inc. developed a 35 cm tall hobby robot with 20 DoF. Retailing for $4,450, this was aimed at researchers that could not afford a full-size HRP-2. (Note: Engadget article says HRP-2 could be rented for a year for $70,000)

#### HRP-2Kai

In order to meet the tight deadline for the DARPA Robotics Challenge, existing HRP-2’s were modified instead of designing a completely new robot. First, the robot was equipped with a laser range finder on its head (UTM-30LX-F) as well as four CCD cameras. The leg and arm links were modified 10 cm longer from the original. Both wrists got a yaw joint that was not on the original HRP-2. Team AIST-NEDO scored 5 points in 52 minutes and 30 seconds at the DARPA Robotics Challenge. Not sure if team HRP2-TOKYO used a HRP-2 or HRP-2Kai, as their robot has some modifications to it.


#### Where are they today?

One HRP-2 is part of the Science Museum Group’s traveling exhibit called Robots. More info at https://www.sciencemuseumgroup.org.uk/our-services/partner-with-us/touring-exhibitions/robots/

One HRP-2 was on display at the Miraikan science museum in Tokyo in January of 2012 (by January 2021 it was no longer on display).
