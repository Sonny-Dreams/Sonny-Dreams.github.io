## The Public's First View into Honda Robotics

  P2 includes a power source, a 138V 6Ah Nickel Zink battery that lasts about 15 minutes, and four Micro SPARC II microprocessors on board. P2 also has an aluminum die-cast outer shell. P2’s weight was increased to 210 kg whereas the height was decreased to 182 cm (compared to P1). Each leg is 6 DoF, each arm is 7 DoF, and each hand is 2 DoF, for a total of 30 DoF. Each actuator is comprised of a brushless DC motor and a harmonic gearbox. The link between joints is made of aluminum. P2 has a maximum walking speed of 2 km/h. P2 also includes a wireless ethernet modem, two cameras, a “tiltmeter”, a gyroscope, and a 6-axis force sensor on each ankle and wrist.

#### Where Are They Today?
  At least two P2’s are known to exist, as one was shown in London at the same time as the one on permanent display at Twin Ring Motegi. The one shown in London is part of the Science Museum Group's traveling exhibit called _Robots_.
