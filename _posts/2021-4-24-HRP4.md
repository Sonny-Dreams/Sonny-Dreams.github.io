HRP-4 was developed as an R&D platform based on the same body mechanism of HRP-4C. HRP-4 has a maximum motor power of 80W making it safer to work with humans. HRP-4 is 1514mm tall with a weight of 39 kg. Each arm is 7 DoF, each hand is 7 DoF, and each leg is 6 DoF. There is 2 DoF in the waist bringing the total 34 DoF.

Notes: Team Nedo-Hydra used a modified HRP-4 at some point during the DARPA Robotics Challenge.

Laboratoire d’Informatique, de Robotique et de Microélectronique de Montpellier (Laboratory of Computer Science, Robotics and Microelectronics of Montpellier) has the only HRP-4 outside of AIST that I know of.
