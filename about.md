### More Information

Currently a robot support engineer at [Agility Robotics](https://www.agilityrobotics.com/). Videos of our robots can be found on our [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN-StetwWuVYf-MU2_NVj4A). I graduated from Purdue University in 2020 after interning at NASA Johnson Space Center and the National Institute of Standards and Technology. I plan on using this website to document personal projects and archive some research I have done into space and robotics.
